## PCIe SMBus Causing Boot Failure

### Summary
If inserting a PCIe device prevents the system from booting, try disabling (shielding) the PCIe SMBus lines.

### Details
The PCH (Platform Controller Hub) provides only a single SMBus channel. To implement full PCIe functionality, the MS-02 Ultra shares the same SMBus routing between the memory module and the PCIe device.

- The memory SMBus is used for memory configuration and frequency negotiation and is critical for proper memory initialization.
- Some PCIe devices implement SMBus incorrectly or pull the bus low, which can disrupt memory SMBus communication and prevent boot.
- Certain PCIe devices (for example, some Intel Optane PCIe SSDs) may present themselves in a way that interferes with SODIMM frequency negotiation, causing the system to fail to boot or the memory not to be recognized.

### Workaround
Mask the PCIe connector SMBus/JTAG pins by applying double-sided tape to physically cover pins 5–9 on the PCIe edge connector (covering at least pins 5 and 6 is essential). This prevents the PCIe device from connecting its SMBus to the shared line.

PCIe front 11 pins (A/B sides) — mask pins 5–9:

| Pin | B-side | A-side | Description |
|-----:|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | +12V | PRSNT1# | Connects to PRSNT2# pin |
| 2 | +12V | +12V | Main power |
| 3 | +12V | +12V | Main power |
| 4 | GND | GND | Ground |
| 5 | SMCLK | TCK | SMBUS and JTAG port |
| 6 | SMDAT | TDI | SMBUS and JTAG port |
| 7 | Ground | TDO | SMBUS and JTAG port |
| 8 | +3.3V | TMS | SMBUS and JTAG port |
| 9 | TRST# | +3.3V | SMBUS and JTAG port |
| 10 | +3.3V AUX | +3.3V | Aux / standby power |
| 11 | WAKE# | PERST | Link reactivation / fundamental reset |

Note: Use non-conductive tape and make sure only the intended pins are masked.

## RTL8127 Driver Leaves Device Unbootable After Shutdown

### Summary
A built-in Linux kernel `r8169` driver in some kernels may leave Realtek RTL8127 NICs in a state after shutdown that prevents the system from powering on again.

### Cause
Certain `r8169` driver implementations on shutdown can put RTL8127 hardware into a non-standard state that disables the NIC's `Power_En` signal. Without this signal the system may fail to start properly on the next power-on attempt.

### Temporary workaround
In BIOS, go to `On Board Setting` and disable the RTL8127 onboard network device to quickly verify whether this is the cause.

### Recommended solution (Solution 1): Install RTL8127 DKMS driver
This is the preferred fix. Use the DKMS package built for RTL8127.

- Download the DKMS package:
  - Example: `https://github.com/minisforum-repo/r8127-dkms/releases/download/11.015.00-1/r8127-dkms_11.015.00-1_all.deb`

PVE / Proxmox VE (ensure you have the No-Subscription repository configured):
Replace the Proxmox VE Enterprise Repository with the No-Subscription Repository:

```bash
tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.sources > /dev/null << 'EOF'
Types: deb
URIs: http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve
Suites: trixie
Components: pve-no-subscription
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
EOF
```

Then proceed with the installation:

```bash
apt update
apt install dkms pve-headers-$(uname -r)
dpkg -i r8127-dkms_11.015.00-1_all.deb
# Reboot and test
```

Ubuntu / Debian:
```bash
apt update
apt install dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
dpkg -i r8127-dkms_11.015.00-1_all.deb
# Reboot and test
```

Verify whether the installation succeeded
```bash
lsmod | grep r8127

# The following output indicates successful installation; if nothing is displayed, the installation failed
# r8127  xxxxxxx 0
```


#### Solution 2: Obtain the Latest Driver from Realtek
Visit: https://www.realtek.com/Download/List?cate_id=584
Download `10G Ethernet LINUX driver r8127 for kernel up to 6.15` and upload it to MS-02 Ultra, then extract.

PVE / Proxmox VE (ensure you have the No-Subscription repository configured):
Replace the Proxmox VE Enterprise Repository with the No-Subscription Repository:

```bash
tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.sources > /dev/null << 'EOF'
Types: deb
URIs: http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve
Suites: trixie
Components: pve-no-subscription
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
EOF
```

Then proceed with the installation:


```bash
apt update

# For PVE system, ensure Proxmox VE No-Subscription Repository is installed
# For PVE system, install PVE Kernel Header and related software
apt install gcc make pve-headers-$(uname -r)


# For Ubuntu/Debian, install Kernel Header and related software
apt install gcc make  linux-headers-$(uname -r)


# Navigate to the directory and run the installation
cd r8127-11.015.00
./autorun.sh
```

Verify whether the installation succeeded
```bash
lsmod | grep r8127

# The following output indicates successful installation; if nothing is displayed, the installation failed
# r8127  xxxxxxx 0
```

## PCIe5.0x16 Slot Cannot using PCIe Passthough

There maybe have some functional conflict in D3 State and forces CLOCK push.   
For compatibility, this slot disables ASPM by default and forces CLOCK push.  
If you got error in this below
```
vfio-pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power staate from D3cold to DO, device inacces
```
It's highly likely that this was encountered.  

In BIOS Setting `Advanced` -> `Onboard Devices Setting` -> `PCI-E Port`  
`Pcie x16 Slot - Clock assignment` Change to `Platform-POR`  
`ClkReq for Pcie x16 Slot Clock` Change to `Platform-POR`  
Will fix this issue.

## EOP4A installed in PCIe 5.0 x16 slot (DEG1/2) causes dedicated GPU malfunction

When ASPM and CLK_REQ are enabled for the PCIe 5.0 x16 slot, using the EOP4A expansion card to connect external OCuLink devices (e.g., graphics cards) may result in boot failure. This issue has been verified on Intel Arc Pro B60 and AMD RX 9060 XT LP, which fail to load the operating system.

### Solution

Access the BIOS and navigate to:
`Advanced` -> `Onboard Devices Setting` -> `PCI-E Port`

Apply the following settings:
Set `Pcie x16 Slot` - `Clock assignment` to `Enabled`

Set `ClkReq for Pcie x16 Slot Clock `to `Disabled`

Set `Pcie x16 Slot-Device1` to` Enabled`

Set `ASPM` to `Disabled`

Set `L1 Substates` to `Disabled`

Set `PCIe Speed` to `Gen4`

The problem will be resolved after applying these configurations.
